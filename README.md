1. Initial Analysis of the Task

The assignment outlines a typical ETL pipeline involving clients sending event data, a server persisting those events, and a separate processor loading aggregated data into a database. The general workflow appears as follows:

- Clients send individual JSON event records.
- The server appends these events to a local file in an append-only manner.
- A separate data processor reads these files, computes per-user revenue, and updates the database.
- The server also exposes a GET endpoint to retrieve user data from the database.

While this setup resembles common log or metrics processing pipelines, the taskâ€™s focus on accurately calculating user revenue introduces additional complexity around consistency and ordering.

2. Key Questions and Assumptions

2.1. Client Considerations

- Multiple Client Instances: The specification does not explicitly clarify whether multiple clients will send data concurrently. For a realistic scenario, I assume multiple clients may submit events simultaneously.

- Event Distribution Across Files: It is unclear if events for a single user could be split across multiple client files. This raises questions about event ordering and conflict resolution during processing.

- Consistency Model for GET Requests: The GET endpoint is expected to return user data potentially immediately after events are posted. Given the asynchronous nature of the data processor, I assume the API provides eventual consistency rather than strong consistency, which better supports scalability and simpler system design.

- API Endpoint Naming: The endpoint /userEvents/{userid} implies returning raw event data, whereas the database only stores aggregated revenue per user. Renaming this endpoint to /userRevenue/{userid} would better align with the data model and expected behavior.

2.2. Data Processor Considerations

- Multiple Event Files: The task mentions that the data processor must handle multiple event files processed at different times, but it does not specify how these files are generated.

- Concurrent Processing and Overlapping Data: If different files contain overlapping events for the same user or time periods, concurrent processing may lead to race conditions or inconsistent database updates. 

- Ordering and Aggregation: Correctly aggregating revenue depends on processing events in the proper order and avoiding duplicates.

2.3. Server Considerations

- Appending Events to a File: The requirement to append all events to a single file, combined with the need for multiple files processed by the data processor, introduces complexity. The specification does not clarify how additional files are created.

- Scalability and Concurrency: Without further specification, implementing a robust solution that handles concurrent clients, multiple event files, and consistent processing is challenging.

2. Proposed Approach

Given the above uncertainties and challenges, I propose using a message broker (e.g., Apache Kafka) to replace the file-based event queue:

- Kafka naturally supports multiple producers and consumers with ordered, durable event logs.
- It simplifies scaling and concurrency, ensuring ordered processing per user partition.
- The data processor can consume events in real time or batch mode without the complexity of file management.

While this deviates from the original file-based design, it offers a more maintainable, scalable, and robust architecture for revenue processing.
